// Explain Diagram
// There is a TS server that starts when VSCode opens
// As I code, it will check for TS errors and show a red squiggly line if it finds issues
// When I fix the issues and the changes are detected, it will check again and remove the squiggly line if it is resolved
// When VSCode is closed, the TS server will stop
